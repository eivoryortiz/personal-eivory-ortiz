Hola, I'm Eivory Ortiz!  I'm a girl in a silly little world (but I'm just a girl).


## Early Life

I was born in Troy, Michigan, raised here in Georgetown, KY. I have been active in my community from a very young age. I am an avid learner.
I love to be creative and take non-convetional approaches to understanding the world around me as this has shaped me for the nexg sections. 

## Georgetown College 

I am a senior currently in Georgetown College, located in Georgetown, KY. I am going to gradaute with a bachelors in political science and computer science. During my time here I have been involved with SHMAC (Student Mental Health Adovocacy Council), Alpha Lambda Delta Honor Society (ALD), and Omicron Kappa Delta Honor Soceity (ODK). I am an independent in this college, meanining that I am not part of a fraternal organization.

## Ambitions

I hope that the future legal field will be able to come together with the computer science field to create a new branch. As we are currently in the age of AI and as such we should be attempting to bridge the gap between the two. Since the two are currently trying to understand one another from just solely their own field. Hence the reason why I and others are invested in bridging the two together by understanding the two to help come together to solve problems that are persisiting between the two. 

## Future Life

I would like to be finanically independent and be able to further help those in understanding the dyanmics of the law and computer science. Mainly as it relates to specifically patent law and data privacy. I would like to be part of a group of lawyers that start a new legal field. Currently right now both areas I have mentioned are separate but I think bringing the two could help emerge one that has a concentration on A.I.
