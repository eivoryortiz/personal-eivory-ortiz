Hola, I'm Eivory Ortiz!  I'm a girl in a silly little world (but I'm just a girl *insert someone saying that's funny*).


## Early Life

I was born in Troy, Michigan, raised here in Georgetown, KY. I have been active in my community from a very young age. I am an avid learner.
I love to be creative and take non-convetional approaches to understanding the world around me as this has shaped me for the next sections. 

## Georgetown College 

I am a senior currently in Georgetown College, located in Georgetown, KY. I am going to gradaute with a bachelors in political science and computer science. During my time here I have been involved with SHMAC (Student Mental Health Adovocacy Council), Alpha Lambda Delta Honor Society (ALD), and Omicron Kappa Delta Honor Soceity (ODK). I am an independent in this college, meanining that I am not part of a fraternal organization. By also taking this class and choosing this minor I have met some wonderful people, the images I have on my website show two girls who also happen to have their own websites too! You can check theirs out too, shoutout to Lexi Taylor and Alex Kincer, may they both be blessed because without them I I don't know how I would've managed to tackle college!

## Ambitions

I hope that the future legal field will be able to come together with the computer science field to create a new branch. As we are currently in the age of AI and as such, we should be attempting to bridge the gap between the two. The two currently are trying to understand one another, but only from their own perspective from their own field. Hence the reason why I and others are invested in bridging the two together by understanding the two to help come together to solve problems that are persisiting between the two. That is a huge ambition I have, but I think for many others who are actively seeking out ways to solve this have made themselves more known!


## Future Life

I would like to be finanically independent and be able to further help those in understanding the dyanmics of the law and computer science. Mainly as it relates to specifically patent law and data privacy. I would like to be part of a group of lawyers that start a new legal field. Currently right now both areas I have mentioned are separate but I think bringing the two could help emerge one that has a concentration on A.I. I am hopeful for what the future brings and I know that collaborating is the way to go! Plus this website also is a nice memoir to have :) !
