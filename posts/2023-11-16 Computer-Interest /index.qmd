## Creating a Website

Many times I have asked myself as far back as I can remember what would it be like if there was a website, book, song, movie, or some other form of media published that could help or inspire others based off my own idea? Lately now its been, what if I created a website that did this? How would it look like and whom should I consult? I knew what computer science was in my youth but not to the extent that I know of it today. Therefore, everything that I have been learning about computer science and what it has done for our world always shocks me, I can say that my reaction is like that of a newborn child's first experience with peek-a-boo. I would say creating a website, that of which I have been tasked to do is by far my faovrite computer programming topic of interest. I am much more appreciative today for the work of computer scientists than I was four years ago and all my life.

In order to create a website, you need an idea for it. Ideas are endless and therefore never ending
