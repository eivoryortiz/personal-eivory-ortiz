This website I am building is the first website I have ever created and with that comes so many new opportunities of exploration. Granted I am also confined to the rubric of my computer science class for this assignment, but this has been such a fun and rewarding experience that makes me grateful for taking a chance on the field of computer science for my minor. So a lot of what I have created, modified, and used for this version of the website you can do as well!
