## SUBSTANTIVE 

Politics is a loaded word that for many carries huge connotations and themes that are complex, scary, or disturbing, or even all of the above to a person. Politics can seem uncomfortable to talk about because of the identification we place ourselves within it. Yet today, more than ever there is a clear sign that politics is now being discussed more locally than it was for years. Talk to anyone who dedicates a portion of their life to the study of politics and they will tell you that this is indeed a new trend that hasn't been seen in ages. Political involvement should be important to everyone. Why? Because we live in a political sphere, I could say the word nation, world, or any other thing to define the territory in which politics resides in, but just as politics can be talked about and enacted upon, so too does it stay in our minds. I would argue that in our subconscious we are political without even realizing. 

So why the need to address this and why does it matter to talk about politics? Because politics at its most basic level involves us and an "other", plain and simple. Our mere exisistence will forever contribute to the changing dynamic of politics. Politics can only work if it has people involved and people can only interact with politics if they themselves are there. However, politics can not be discussed in just one blog post, nor can all of politics can be discussed in one day to someone. That is why it is important to have conversations, records, and events teaching about politics that allow for it to be less stigmatized and uncomfortable to the rest of society. In many countries around the world, the topic of politics is taboo. Here where I am from, there is a body of law that protects the speech of politics. This is known as the First Amendment, within the United States Constitution, which is part of a series of personal law known as the Bill of Rights, of which there are 10. 

Due to this law, upheld by this nation, I and anyone else have the protected right to discuss politics, although the amendment doesn't mention the words politics explicitly, this amendment carries a lot of connotation within the legal field that any political discourse is allowed at its most basic level because of this amendment's language. That doesn't mean that there will be no consequences for that of immoral or unethical discourse, but you have every right to express your voice. Having a voice ultimately is what allows for people like you and I to able to read something like this blog and not fear for our lives that we will be under scrutinty according to the law of the land. 

With all that said, lets recognize now what self I am discussing in understanding how to educate ourselves amidst the political sphere. Education is not a one and down, its not easy, nor is it challenging, education is simply what you make of it. So while I could cater to your own experience of your education journey, whether this is you learning through self-help books, watching videos, going to some education institution, etc... the process is different for everyone. No one has the same education journey in life, that's the beauty of life lessons that can't be confined to certain places where you are expected to have "learned" everything. Politics works in this same way, it is constantly changing, while also establishing foundations. Politics is neverending, so long as we make it neverending. 

I am a political science major with a minor in computer science. Throughout my time in undergrad, I have learned an enormous amount of information, through various modes of learning. It would be an understatement to say that I wasn't overwhelmed from the beginning to today. I love learning, and while I could give a philosophical response to why I find learning important and all that it wouldn't be true to the reality in which I found for myself why I love learning. As far as memory goes, my first moment of feeling comfortable, secure, and one with myself in learning was when I was learning to spell for the first time. I have not always been a fan of language nor reading all my life, but when I was learning how to spell words, that eventually lead to sentences, which lead to reading, I felt invincible. 

This feeling of invincibility lead me to have a core memory of enjoying to learn because in order for me to able to type on this laptop of mine someone along the way had to teach me how to read and write and spell. Or else how would I be able to get here?
