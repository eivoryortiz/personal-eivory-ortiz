<p><em>Dear Person Reading This,</em></p>
<p>Politics is a loaded word that for many carries huge connotations and themes that are complex, scary, or disturbing, or even all of the above to a person. Politics can seem uncomfortable to talk about because of the identification we place ourselves within it. Yet today, more than ever there is a clear sign that politics is now being discussed more locally than it was for years. Talk to anyone who dedicates a portion of their life to the study of politics and they will tell you that this is indeed a new trend that hasn’t been seen in ages. Political involvement should be important to everyone. Why? Because we live in a political sphere, I could say the word nation, world, or any other thing to define the territory in which politics resides in, but just as politics can be talked about and enacted upon, so too does it stay in our minds. I would argue that in our subconscious we are political without even realizing.</p>
<p>So why the need to address this and why does it matter to talk about politics? Because politics at its most basic level involves us and an “other”, plain and simple. Our mere exisistence will forever contribute to the changing dynamic of politics. Politics can only work if it has people involved and people can only interact with politics if they themselves are there. However, politics can not be discussed in just one blog post, nor can all of politics can be discussed in one day to someone. That is why it is important to have conversations, records, and events teaching about politics that allow for it to be less stigmatized and uncomfortable to the rest of society. In many countries around the world, the topic of politics is taboo. Here where I am from, there is a body of law that protects the speech of politics. This is known as the First Amendment, within the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, of which there are 10.</p>
<p>Due to this law, upheld by this nation, I and anyone else have the protected right to discuss politics, although the amendment doesn’t mention the words politics explicitly, this amendment carries a lot of connotation within the legal field that any political discourse is allowed at its most basic level because of this amendment’s language. That doesn’t mean that there will be no consequences for that of immoral or unethical discourse, but you have every right to express your voice. Having a voice ultimately is what allows for people like you and I to able to read something like this blog and not fear for our lives that we will be under scrutinty according to the law of the land.</p>
<p>With all that said, lets recognize now what self I am discussing in understanding how to educate ourselves amidst the political sphere. Education is not a one and down, its not easy, nor is it challenging, education is simply what you make of it. So while I could cater to your own experience of your education journey, whether this is you learning through self-help books, watching videos, going to some education institution, etc… the process is different for everyone. No one has the same education journey in life, that’s the beauty of life lessons that can’t be confined to certain places where you are expected to have “learned” everything. Politics works in this same way, it is constantly changing, while also establishing foundations. Politics is neverending, so long as we make it neverending.</p>
<p>I am a political science major with a minor in computer science. Throughout my time in undergrad, I have learned an enormous amount of information, through various modes of learning. It would be an understatement to say that I wasn’t overwhelmed from the beginning to today. I love learning, and while I could give a philosophical response to why I find learning important and all that it wouldn’t be true to the reality in which I found for myself why I love learning. As far as memory goes, my first moment of feeling comfortable, secure, and one with myself in learning was when I was learning to spell for the first time. I have not always been a fan of language nor reading all my life, but when I was learning how to spell words, that eventually lead to sentences, which lead to reading, I felt invincible.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
This feeling of invincibility lead me to have a core memory of enjoying to learn because in order for me to able to type on this laptop of mine someone along the way had to teach me how to read and write and spell. Or else how would I be able to get here?
</blockquote>
<p>Politics can be best learned through our own life experience first. By embracing the fact that government and politics impacts our life, is the first approach to educating ourselves. Write down what you think impacts you the most, based off this exercise ask yourself how does this impact others around you? If it does impact others around you, ask yourself would this impact their perspective on our government. From that point onward you will start to build empathy for the collective ideas that politics can create but as well for that of the indivudal. This will be a guiding point for you to see how indirectly or directly politics effects us.</p>
<p>If that option does not appeal, ask someone who you know is politically open. What I mean is that they are open to expressing their political beliefs with you just as they would be open to expressing them to the residing President of the United States or any government leader for that matter. These are the people you want to see and research on because they shape politic culture just as much or more than you. There are stereotypes in politics and this is true for just about anything, but you have to be willing to understand the history that shaped those.</p>
<p>This is why I recommend that now you should be actively reading as much as you can when you can politics. Politics has some loaded issues and there are some that are plain, but being able to see the interconnectivty is what will allow you to be able to make informed opinions later on. Peer-reviewed journals are great starting points to see a particular political topic of your choosing to understand the need for educationg regarding politics. I would suggest you find one article that aligns with your political beliefs and one that does not when first attempting this. You will have to compare and contrast what exactly the two sides did best on defending their political claim. Then from there ask yourself which one you think aligns more today with the world, your country, and then you. The reason for this is to eventually go beyond domestic politics and understand international politics.</p>
<p>Because just only investigating and caring for the local level in which you reside discludes a huge factor in understanding how politics has impacted the world. By now you will have started to either enjoy politics or dislike it, but the feeling of curiosity will linger and this is what will shape more your political views than either of the two feelings. Media, specifically movies, TV shows, and music would be my next recommendation on educating yourself on politics.</p>
<p>Although its not everyones first choice, there are a lot of media options that cover politics, address,or attack it. Music to me is the most intersting by far of the media choices that I would recommend learning first. A lot of songs that have been made have political implications, and songs like anthems for a country are in nature political. This will allow not only for you to listen but also read the lyrics to see the political tone. Music can do a marvelous job of expressing things often times we have hard time saying just by talking, so having a beat or some cool solo allows us to feel what they are saying in an artistic manner. There are lots of streaming services that have playlists already curated for politics that you should give a listen too. Based off this experience, if you try it that is, I would recommend that you see if these songs were in a movie or TV show. Because often than not they are, and then you will be interested in seeing that and knowing what exactly is the politics being displayed.</p>
<p>These options I have given are not the sole way to learn politics nor will be everyones first choice, but the way in which politics has shaped my own life has allowed me to give this tutorial if you will to help someone else begin their journey in understanding politics. You should at this point need to know and want to know the government, the structure of the government, who in the government is responsible for what you care about politically, who makes certain decisions, and etc… You should also be able to see that there is unbiased opinions in politics. That its not just a ‘government leader’ issue or a ‘political party’ drama scandal.</p>
<p>Yes, politics can be classified as an entertaining drama. But the drama that politics is expressing is of the life we live. Sure there are moments of exaggeration and moments of despair and moments that are shocking we don’t know how to react to it in politics. But the overall importance in my opinion, for why educating ourselves on politics is important is because it deals with our lives. There are many things in this world we can not control, but politics is one of the things in which we can control if we want too, and since politics impacts both you and me. It should be important that we treat this breathing subject with a degree of discipline and control to better ourselves and better the world. Not for to benefit one exclusively and let the rest parish, but to unite and come to middle grounds so that collectively we can be bipartisan.</p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em> <em>Eivory Ortiz</em></p>
