I love to be creative and take non-convetional approaches to understanding the world around me as this has shaped me and allows me to go further into detail about some of myself. If you had asked me if I ever thought I would take a computer science class much less have the life I live today I would’ve been jaw dropped with no response for you, but that’s life and everyone changes!"

I am an independent in this college, meanining that I am not part of a fraternal organization. By also taking this class and choosing this minor I have met some wonderful people, the images I have on my website show two girls who also happen to have their own websites too! You can check theirs out too, shoutout to Lexi Taylor and Alex Kincer, may they both be blessed because without them I I don’t know how I would’ve managed to tackle college! They have taken the same CSC324 class that I did for the 2023 fall semester here at Georgetown College and they have their own variations of their website!\nLexi’s Website: https://lexitaylor5.github.io/personal-lexi-taylor/\nAlex’s Website: https://alexkincer1.github.io/personal-alex-kincer/"

As we are currently in the age of AI and as such, we should be attempting to bridge the gap between the two. The two currently are trying to understand one another, but only from their own perspective from their own field. Hence the reason why I and others are invested in bridging the two together by understanding the two to help come together to solve problems that are persisiting between the two. That is a huge ambition I have, but I think for many others who are actively seeking out ways to solve this have made themselves more known!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lyrics are something that fascinate and always have been.\nI don’t think I would like music if it weren’t for lyrics. At least part of it. This is why I think people should study more lyrics and really consider the evolution of words in music.\nBecause for a long period of time there weren’t words in music and by that I mean songs. So this is why it is relatively new in concept. And therefore should be looked more into. I would even comment that it is important that we appreciate lyrics more now than ever. As it seems that we are advancing more into the age of AI. The usage of creativity in all areas is starting to become a part of the reason for AI’s usage. Whether this would be on social media or to the usage of song writing.\nLyrics can help convey the song just the same way someone would read a poem or a book that they are wanting to get a meaning out of. People write in journals to let go or express their feelings, lyrics can encompass all of this with music. I wish more people knew how people feel about lyrics.\nMainly in the sense that when people dedicate others songs majority of the time it is because of the lyrics, but if you have a background in music theory than of course you are going to go above and beyond when it comes to recommedning and even dedicating songs. Especially if lyrics are involved because you are understand that they too shape music.\nIt is due to this that I want more people to invest in lyric history, I was fortunate enough to get a class in my time in college regarding the history of music taught by Professor Powell and it really helped broadened but as well shap my appreciation for music but as well lyrics. How people can express themselves is so fascinating and especially in regards to writing albums. Because you’re not just writing one song you are writing multiple. And even songs that just have one word but that word lyric matter to the art of the song help revolutionize music genres too!\nLyrics can make or break for some people what songs they listen too but nevertheless I think it is important to realize that there is value in understanding the art of lyrics. What words mean and what exactly can music do for you and what it can do to others. There is so much information out there regarding music and I do not think we as a society will ever stop producing music, but as a suggestion to those that have read up until now this brief article, I would suggest to start researching lyrics and why it shaped the evolution of music today as we know it."

    "title": "Why Being Yourself Is In Fact Challenging",
    "section": "",
    "text": "No matter where you go and what you do it seems as if being yourself is a taunting thing to be. No one prepares you for the consequences and really the reality of the world when you are actually yourself. What it means to be yourself is something many have asked and many wonder today what or how we should go about approaching this question.\nAlthough for me I can say currently it is easy for me to be myself, who knows if I will be able to say that much less type that when I am 50. I and others are constantly changing and because of this we really don’t know exactly how we are going to be portrayed or remember later on in life. Causing many to become stressed over this issue. Because who really knows what being yourself actually means.\nThere are many things in this world that shape our perception of time and our perception of the things around this. This has room to cause for others to say whether or not it made you who you are today. I would argue that it is important to note that learning is involved in the process to being yourself. This can range from the phrases people say about “mind, heart, soul” or something along the lines of “I am me because of GOD”.\nAll of which are valid, but still the question remains about why it is difficult to be yourself. There are versions of yourself past and present and of course future. What you say and do can be reflective of the current you or a past you or a future you. But you should not be always held in the status of being untouchable or immoral or God like. It’s simply not achievable nor should it be. Many people give people this idea that they have to be perfect. When in reality being perfect is impossible.\nSomeone can say that cheesy line of the word impossible means im possible but that simply isn’t true, do humans have wings? No. So why would you say to someone it isn’t impossible when you know for a fact that humans can’t have wings? This is the same rhetoric that goes on when you tell someone they can be themselves but you are holding them to standard. Or you are projectingg yourself onto them. This is also bad.\nBecause you are not giving the person the living breathing option to be themselves but rather you are trying to either macro or micro control them on how they should be themselves. If everyone was truly their most authentic selves this world would be different. But because of much unresolved issues people are dealing with regarding unrealisitic expectations. Many will never be truly themselves.\nOne could argue that I am on a high horse right now with what I have mentioned. There is room for that statement, but rest assure that just as there is room for that there is room for mine as well and all that fall along the spectrum of this discussion. Why? Because no human shares the same experience regardless if there is similarities to this life. It is still uniquely yours and what you choose to do or say with the free will is entirely up to you. Or it could be determined by circumstances or by others, the list goes on. But ultimately you have right to get to know you.\nYou have the undeniable right to live, and to live also implies to be yourself, and although this topic is so vast and complex I hope to whoever reads this at least knows that being yourself will never hurt you in comparison to all the benefits you’ll get from it helping you!"

Now lets discuss how we got the colors to be changed.\n\nThis is the code regarding the styles.css file that is needed for to make the change of the color of the primary and secondary buttons I coded into my website.\n\n\nFirst off you want to make sure that the following code matches the language you are writing your website in and in this case its javascript. I had typed in my first buttons name which is .btn-primary and I inserted curly brackets to tell what specifically makes up the new style change for my button. Which in this case is the background color. I am not doing an overshadow, nor am I changing the text color, I simply want to modify the background of the default primary button color given in Quarto.\nSecond, I can choose my color once I insert the colon in which I will be given a load of options from here until I find the color I want. In this case I wanted orange, so I typed in orange.\nThird and finally, I was taught by my professor Dr.White that anything I wanted Quarto to know regarding this website I am making through VSCode to make sure it runs I insert an exclamation point followed by the word important. And because this is the end of my code needed to modify my button I insert the semicolon and curly bracket and saved my changes and ran it in the terminal.\n\n.btn-primary {\nbackground-color: orange !important;\n}\n\n.btn-secondary {\nbackground-color: pink !important;\n}"

I did do another enhancement which was change my navbar to a different color other than the one provided by default for Quarto. So I will explain that as it is a modification that is not a default.\n\nExplaining\n\nThe same is applicable for the changing of the header or in this case the navbar. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/ This link is for where specifically I found how to change navbar settings.\nI went into the style.css file and I typed in navbar-dark followed by a comma and then navbar-light then followed by another comma till finally .navbar. This is because my default navbar on Quarto is following a background of light that I typed into my Quarto Yml but is also what will help me see the text when the final navbar is complete.\nThen I opened up a curly bracket in which I insert what I specifically am changing in the navbar from its default and this is its background color. So I type in background-color and its followed by a colon to call upon the colors and I wanted something that went with the color scheme I had so I chose lightsalmon.\nI then closed it with the semi-colon and curly bracket and saved my new change to the navbar and then ran in the terminal my website to preview the changes I had made here on VSCode. It was to my liking and now you can do it too!\n\n\n.navbar-dark, navbar-light, .navbar{\n    background-color: lightsalmon;\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Dear Person Reading This,\nPolitics is a loaded word that for many carries huge connotations and themes that are complex, scary, or disturbing, or even all of the above to a person. Politics can seem uncomfortable to talk about because of the identification we place ourselves within it. Yet today, more than ever there is a clear sign that politics is now being discussed more locally than it was for years. Talk to anyone who dedicates a portion of their life to the study of politics and they will tell you that this is indeed a new trend that hasn’t been seen in ages. Political involvement should be important to everyone. Why? Because we live in a political sphere, I could say the word nation, world, or any other thing to define the territory in which politics resides in, but just as politics can be talked about and enacted upon, so too does it stay in our minds. I would argue that in our subconscious we are political without even realizing.\nSo why the need to address this and why does it matter to talk about politics? Because politics at its most basic level involves us and an “other”, plain and simple. Our mere exisistence will forever contribute to the changing dynamic of politics. Politics can only work if it has people involved and people can only interact with politics if they themselves are there. However, politics can not be discussed in just one blog post, nor can all of politics can be discussed in one day to someone. That is why it is important to have conversations, records, and events teaching about politics that allow for it to be less stigmatized and uncomfortable to the rest of society. In many countries around the world, the topic of politics is taboo. Here where I am from, there is a body of law that protects the speech of politics. This is known as the First Amendment, within the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, of which there are 10.\nDue to this law, upheld by this nation, I and anyone else have the protected right to discuss politics, although the amendment doesn’t mention the words politics explicitly, this amendment carries a lot of connotation within the legal field that any political discourse is allowed at its most basic level because of this amendment’s language. That doesn’t mean that there will be no consequences for that of immoral or unethical discourse, but you have every right to express your voice. Having a voice ultimately is what allows for people like you and I to able to read something like this blog and not fear for our lives that we will be under scrutinty according to the law of the land.\nWith all that said, lets recognize now what self I am discussing in understanding how to educate ourselves amidst the political sphere. Education is not a one and down, its not easy, nor is it challenging, education is simply what you make of it. So while I could cater to your own experience of your education journey, whether this is you learning through self-help books, watching videos, going to some education institution, etc… the process is different for everyone. No one has the same education journey in life, that’s the beauty of life lessons that can’t be confined to certain places where you are expected to have “learned” everything. Politics works in this same way, it is constantly changing, while also establishing foundations. Politics is neverending, so long as we make it neverending.\nI am a political science major with a minor in computer science. Throughout my time in undergrad, I have learned an enormous amount of information, through various modes of learning. It would be an understatement to say that I wasn’t overwhelmed from the beginning to today. I love learning, and while I could give a philosophical response to why I find learning important and all that it wouldn’t be true to the reality in which I found for myself why I love learning. As far as memory goes, my first moment of feeling comfortable, secure, and one with myself in learning was when I was learning to spell for the first time. I have not always been a fan of language nor reading all my life, but when I was learning how to spell words, that eventually lead to sentences, which lead to reading, I felt invincible.\n\nThis feeling of invincibility lead me to have a core memory of enjoying to learn because in order for me to able to type on this laptop of mine someone along the way had to teach me how to read and write and spell. Or else how would I be able to get here?\n\nPolitics can be best learned through our own life experience first. By embracing the fact that government and politics impacts our life, is the first approach to educating ourselves. Write down what you think impacts you the most, based off this exercise ask yourself how does this impact others around you? If it does impact others around you, ask yourself would this impact their perspective on our government. From that point onward you will start to build empathy for the collective ideas that politics can create but as well for that of the indivudal. This will be a guiding point for you to see how indirectly or directly politics effects us.\nIf that option does not appeal, ask someone who you know is politically open. What I mean is that they are open to expressing their political beliefs with you just as they would be open to expressing them to the residing President of the United States or any government leader for that matter. These are the people you want to see and research on because they shape politic culture just as much or more than you. There are stereotypes in politics and this is true for just about anything, but you have to be willing to understand the history that shaped those.\nThis is why I recommend that now you should be actively reading as much as you can when you can politics. Politics has some loaded issues and there are some that are plain, but being able to see the interconnectivty is what will allow you to be able to make informed opinions later on. Peer-reviewed journals are great starting points to see a particular political topic of your choosing to understand the need for educationg regarding politics. I would suggest you find one article that aligns with your political beliefs and one that does not when first attempting this. You will have to compare and contrast what exactly the two sides did best on defending their political claim. Then from there ask yourself which one you think aligns more today with the world, your country, and then you. The reason for this is to eventually go beyond domestic politics and understand international politics.\nBecause just only investigating and caring for the local level in which you reside discludes a huge factor in understanding how politics has impacted the world. By now you will have started to either enjoy politics or dislike it, but the feeling of curiosity will linger and this is what will shape more your political views than either of the two feelings. Media, specifically movies, TV shows, and music would be my next recommendation on educating yourself on politics.\nAlthough its not everyones first choice, there are a lot of media options that cover politics, address,or attack it. Music to me is the most intersting by far of the media choices that I would recommend learning first. A lot of songs that have been made have political implications, and songs like anthems for a country are in nature political. This will allow not only for you to listen but also read the lyrics to see the political tone. Music can do a marvelous job of expressing things often times we have hard time saying just by talking, so having a beat or some cool solo allows us to feel what they are saying in an artistic manner. There are lots of streaming services that have playlists already curated for politics that you should give a listen too. Based off this experience, if you try it that is, I would recommend that you see if these songs were in a movie or TV show. Because often than not they are, and then you will be interested in seeing that and knowing what exactly is the politics being displayed.\nThese options I have given are not the sole way to learn politics nor will be everyones first choice, but the way in which politics has shaped my own life has allowed me to give this tutorial if you will to help someone else begin their journey in understanding politics. You should at this point need to know and want to know the government, the structure of the government, who in the government is responsible for what you care about politically, who makes certain decisions, and etc… You should also be able to see that there is unbiased opinions in politics. That its not just a ‘government leader’ issue or a ‘political party’ drama scandal.\nYes, politics can be classified as an entertaining drama. But the drama that politics is expressing is of the life we live. Sure there are moments of exaggeration and moments of despair and moments that are shocking we don’t know how to react to it in politics. But the overall importance in my opinion, for why educating ourselves on politics is important is because it deals with our lives. There are many things in this world we can not control, but politics is one of the things in which we can control if we want too, and since politics impacts both you and me. It should be important that we treat this breathing subject with a degree of discipline and control to better ourselves and better the world. Not for to benefit one exclusively and let the rest parish, but to unite and come to middle grounds so that collectively we can be bipartisan.\nSincerely, Eivory Ortiz"

    "text": "Understanding the Code\nThe every function is the name of this function we are creating but as well it is defning two parameters.\nOne of which is the array and the second is the predicate.\nEssentially what this does together will go through a loop using iteration over each element in the array part.\n\nThe if statement line of code checks to see if the predicate function returns false for any element.\nIf that is the case then it will return false.\nIf however that isn’t the case then it will return as true.\n\n\nThe second part of this function is the every2.\nIt follows along the same method as the previous function.\n\n\nIt has the same parameters, the array and predicate.\n\n\nThe some method is different as it is checking to see if there are any elements for which predicate can return false.\nThe arrow function in this negates the result of predicate. So in this case it is using the NOT operator aka !\n\n\nThe result of the some method is negated once again using the ! to do the same thing as the every function.\n\nOnce we have all that we can console.log to print our our every functions.\nSo in this case the first one is checking to see if every element in the array is less than 10, should come back as true. The second one is checking to see if every element in the array is less than 10 and should return back false. Last one is checking if every element is less than 10 and should come back as true because none of them met the conditions we stated."

In my CSC324 class we use GitHub, I highly recommend you use it too if you are beginning your computer science journey!\n\nThe Book here\nThe Solution here\n\nIt is worth noting that the link for the solution also shows two other problems as well that were solved!\n\nNow for the code to Flattening!\nlet arrays = [[1,2,3], [4,5], [6]];\nconsole.log(arrays.reduce((flat, current) =&gt; flat.concat(current), []));\n\n\nThis is involving an array.\n\n\n\nWe are flattening a nested array by using the reduce method. We declare the variable arrays and assign it the numbers you see nested that we are trying to flatten.\n\n\n\nWe use the console.log to print out the current array with the flattened one, by using the concat method to merge the two. We have an empty array which will be used for to store the flatted array in.\n\n\n\nThe reduce method iterates for us each element in the arrays variable and applies the reducer function to then return the flattened array for us. As stated before the console.log statment is for the output of the flattened array to be shown to us.\n\n\n\nThis was to show by using javascript language how to flatten nested arrays by using the reduce method. By using this as an example you can acheive this with whatever flattening situation you are trying to solve yourself as a beginners guide! Of course taking into consideration what was the purpose of this function in particular but building off of it can be useful!"

    "text": "I am explaining two homework problems from CSC324 in my computer science class at my college. Essentially these problems are from Eloquent Javascript Third Edition which can be found online. I am going to explain Flattening and Everything from Chapter 5 in the textbook. These two problems deal with higher order functions. If you are interested in learning about computer science I recommend it! These codes deal with Javascript but at my time here in Georgetown while pursuing my minor I have also studied R Studio Language! I have also linked my GitHub account in this website specifically taking you to the solution I uploaded for the HW we had in this class. It has another solution to a problem title Looping that you can find as well! I am testing out currently new styles and layout for this website so that in the future I can see what aesthetics I prefer compared to what I have right now! So be on the lookour for changes to my website coming soon!"
