As we are currently in the age of AI and as such we should be attempting to bridge the gap between the two. Since the two are currently trying to understand one another from just solely their own field. Hence the reason why I and others are invested in bridging the two together by understanding the two to help come together to solve problems that are persisiting between the two."

Mainly as it relates to specifically patent law and data privacy. I would like to be part of a group of lawyers that start a new legal field. Currently right now both areas I have mentioned are separate but I think bringing the two could help emerge one that has a concentration on A.I."
