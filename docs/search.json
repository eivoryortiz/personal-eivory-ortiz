During my time here I have been involved with SHMAC (Student Mental Health Adovocacy Council), Alpha Lambda Delta Honor Society (ALD), and Omicron Kappa Delta Honor Soceity (ODK). I am an independent in this college, meanining that I am not part of a fraternal organization. By also taking this class and choosing this minor I have met some wonderful people, the images I have on my website show two girls who also happen to have their own websites too! You can check theirs out too, shoutout to Lexi Taylor and Alex Kincer, may they both be blessed because without them I I don’t know how I would’ve managed to tackle college!"

As we are currently in the age of AI and as such, we should be attempting to bridge the gap between the two. The two currently are trying to understand one another, but only from their own perspective from their own field. Hence the reason why I and others are invested in bridging the two together by understanding the two to help come together to solve problems that are persisiting between the two. That is a huge ambition I have, but I think for many others who are actively seeking out ways to solve this have made themselves more known!"

Currently right now both areas I have mentioned are separate but I think bringing the two could help emerge one that has a concentration on A.I.

Essentially these problems are from Eloquent Javascript Third Edition which can be found online. I am going to explain Flattening and Everything from Chapter 5 in the textbook. These two problems deal with higher order functions. If you are interested in learning about computer science I recommend it! These codes deal with Javascript but at my time here in Georgetown while pursuing my minor I have also studied R Studio Language! I have also linked my GitHub account in this website specifically taking you to the solution I uploaded for the HW we had in this class. It has another solution to a problem title Looping that you can find as well! I am testing out currently new styles and layout for this website so that in the future I can see what aesthetics I prefer compared to what I have right now! So be on the lookour for changes to my website coming soon!"

So in this case it is using the NOT operator aka !\n\n\nThe result of the some method is negated once again using the ! to do the same thing as the every function.\n\nOnce we have all that we can console.log to print our our every functions.\nSo in this case the first one is checking to see if every element in the array is less than 10, should come back as true. The second one is checking to see if every element in the array is less than 10 and should return back false. Last one is checking if every element is less than 10 and should come back as true because none of them met the conditions we stated."

    "text": "Politics is a loaded word that for many carries huge connotations and themes that are complex, scary, or disturbing, or even all of the above to a person. Politics can seem uncomfortable to talk about because of the identification we place ourselves within it. Yet today, more than ever there is a clear sign that politics is now being discussed more locally than it was for years. Talk to anyone who dedicates a portion of their life to the study of politics and they will tell you that this is indeed a new trend that hasn’t been seen in ages. Political involvement should be important to everyone. Why? Because we live in a political sphere, I could say the word nation, world, or any other thing to define the territory in which politics resides in, but just as politics can be talked about and enacted upon, so too does it stay in our minds. I would argue that in our subconscious we are political without even realizing.\nSo why the need to address this and why does it matter to talk about politics? Because politics at its most basic level involves us and an “other”, plain and simple. Our mere exisistence will forever contribute to the changing dynamic of politics. Politics can only work if it has people involved and people can only interact with politics if they themselves are there. However, politics can not be discussed in just one blog post, nor can all of politics can be discussed in one day to someone. That is why it is important to have conversations, records, and events teaching about politics that allow for it to be less stigmatized and uncomfortable to the rest of society. In many countries around the world, the topic of politics is taboo. Here where I am from, there is a body of law that protects the speech of politics. This is known as the First Amendment, within the United States Constitution, which is part of a series of personal law known as the Bill of Rights, of which there are 10.\nDue to this law, upheld by this nation, I and anyone else have the protected right to discuss politics, although the amendment doesn’t mention the words politics explicitly, this amendment carries a lot of connotation within the legal field that any political discourse is allowed at its most basic level because of this amendment’s language. That doesn’t mean that there will be no consequences for that of immoral or unethical discourse, but you have every right to express your voice. Having a voice ultimately is what allows for people like you and I to able to read something like this blog and not fear for our lives that we will be under scrutinty according to the law of the land.\nWith all that said, lets recognize now what self I am discussing in understanding how to educate ourselves amidst the political sphere. Education is not a one and down, its not easy, nor is it challenging, education is simply what you make of it. So while I could cater to your own experience of your education journey, whether this is you learning through self-help books, watching videos, going to some education institution, etc… the process is different for everyone. No one has the same education journey in life, that’s the beauty of life lessons that can’t be confined to certain places where you are expected to have “learned” everything. Politics works in this same way, it is constantly changing, while also establishing foundations. Politics is neverending, so long as we make it neverending.\nI am a political science major with a minor in computer science. Throughout my time in undergrad, I have learned an enormous amount of information, through various modes of learning. It would be an understatement to say that I wasn’t overwhelmed from the beginning to today. I love learning, and while I could give a philosophical response to why I find learning important and all that it wouldn’t be true to the reality in which I found for myself why I love learning. As far as memory goes, my first moment of feeling comfortable, secure, and one with myself in learning was when I was learning to spell for the first time. I have not always been a fan of language nor reading all my life, but when I was learning how to spell words, that eventually lead to sentences, which lead to reading, I felt invincible.\nThis feeling of invincibility lead me to have a core memory of enjoying to learn because in order for me to able to type on this laptop of mine someone along the way had to teach me how to read and write and spell. Or else how would I be able to get here?"

In my CSC324 class we use GitHub, I highly recommend you use it too if you are beginning your computer science journey!\n\nThe Book here\nThe Solution here\n\nIt is worth noting that the link for the solution also shows two other problems as well that were solved!\n\nNow for the code to Flattening!\nlet arrays = [[1,2,3], [4,5], [6]];\nconsole.log(arrays.reduce((flat, current) =&gt; flat.concat(current), []));\n\n\nThis is involving an array.\n\n\n\nWe are flattening a nested array by using the reduce method. We declare the variable arrays and assign it the numbers you see nested that we are trying to flatten.\n\n\n\nWe use the console.log to print out the current array with the flattened one, by using the concat method to merge the two. We have an empty array which will be used for to store the flatted array in.\n\n\n\nThe reduce method iterates for us each element in the arrays variable and applies the reducer function to then return the flattened array for us. As stated before the console.log statment is for the output of the flattened array to be shown to us.\n\n\n\nThis was to show by using javascript language how to flatten nested arrays by using the reduce method. By using this as an example you can acheive this with whatever flattening situation you are trying to solve yourself as a beginners guide! Of course taking into consideration what was the purpose of this function in particular but building off of it can be useful!"
