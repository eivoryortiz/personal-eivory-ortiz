I am doing two homework problems from CSC324 in my computer science class at my college.
Essentially these problems are from Eloquent Javascript Third Edition which can be found online. 
I am going to explain Flattening and Everything from Chapter 5 in the textbook. 
These two problems deal with higher order functions.
