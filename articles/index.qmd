I am explaining two homework problems from CSC324 in my computer science class at my college.
Essentially these problems are from Eloquent Javascript Third Edition which can be found online. 
I am going to explain Flattening and Everything from Chapter 5 in the textbook. 
These two problems deal with higher order functions. 
If you are interested in learning about computer science I recommend it!
These codes deal with Javascript but at my time here in Georgetown while pursuing my minor I have also studied R Studio Language!
I have also linked my GitHub account in this website specifically taking you to the solution I uploaded for the HW we had in this class.
It has another solution to a problem title Looping that you can find as well!
I am testing out currently new styles and layout for this website so that in the future I can see what aesthetics I prefer compared to what I have right now! So be on the lookour for changes to my website coming soon!
